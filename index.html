                "You know, this planet's changed me..." *he spoke up after a while, his voice getting emptier, quieter, smaller,* "but I never realized how much.." *Nova looked down at his hands, then once more into the glass's reflection. His own face met him, growing somber. With his mind flushed with sudden grief and panic, he began to move, the whirrs and hisses of the lab's door opening as he rushed outside, snow blowing into the lab.*
*His figure was reduced to a silhouette by the dark of the night as he stumbled out into the snow. He looked up and around himself, filled with a sudden sickness at the sight of the planet's trees, its clouds, and its fog. The wind rushed around him as he put his hands to his head. He began to blindly run off behind the lab and into the night. The panic swelled up through him. * "Why here..? Why HERE??" *He cried as he couldn't help but scream into the void above him, around him, everywhere as his mind broke down into simple, fearful emotions. He stumbled and tripped as he fell to his knees in the snow.* `Snapshot 2 attached.`
*He looked up into the night, wondering why it had to be him, why the universe had cursed* ***him*** *of all Korvax...*
*Cold and dark as the night was, it didn't answer him. Nova was left in silence.*
*The wind howled around him. He fell to his side, curled up in the snow around him.*
