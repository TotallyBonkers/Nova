            The wind is heard howling behind the crackles of flames from the crashed ship nearby. Animals are just
            barely heard scuttering around.
            The garbled sounds of a Korvax are heard as Nova awakens.

        <br>
        "<span class="dialogue">Where exactly am I?</span>"
        <br>
        He gazed at the landscape as he tried to remember just who he was, and what he was doing on a snowy planet. Minutes pass in silence. He looks to his ship, then the memory strikes him. 
        <br>
        "<span class="dialogue">I am a Field Researcher for the.. EV-3 Hibuyama. My name's Nova, I think, and I believe I have some sort of reason to be on this planet.. but I just.. can't remember where this is or why I'm here for the life of me. I need a while to regain my bearings..</span>"

            The camera's propped up on something now. Nova is facing the camera, speaking.
            <br>
            "<span class="dialogue">I am Field Researcher Nova of the EV-3 Hibuyama.. this is Day 1.</span>" He spoke as a form of documentation and reminding himself.

        "<span class="dialogue">My memory banks are still failing me for most details, but if I had to guess based on my title, I'm here to research this planet for some reason.</span>" Nova turned away from the camera and toward the ship. He approached it, running his hand across it and inspecting the damage.
        <br>            
        "<span class="dialogue">I believe I've crash landed here.. which is easy to believe because it's quite obvious. Though I'm not sure if I was intended to land here or some other planet. I think I'm going to spend the rest of today trying to see what's left of my ship.</span>"
        As he got further from the camera, the sounds of him were drowned out by the light winds. He hopped into the ship, and the camera turned off.

            Nova was actively taking steps away from the ship.

            "<span class="dialogue">Immediately I'm noticing a bunch of animals around me.

        "<span class="dialogue">So, I've been scanning the resources of this planet as I've gone along, and.. wait..</span>"
        His pace quickened, and then stopped entirely. Clicks were heard as he pulled out his multitool, followed by the scans of something.
       <br><br>
        "<span class="dialogue">It looks like.. a plant! Down here, in a cave of all places!</span>"
        He shook his multitool a few times, until eventually he just smacked it, turning his flashlight on finally.

        Nova is heard climbing out, some snow falling into the cave below. He's silent, the only audible sounds being of nature, his footsteps, his quiet, synthetic breathing, and the wind.
        Eventually, he began to scan things around him.
        <br>
        "<span class="dialogue">Now we're really in business,</span>"

        <br>

            "<span class="dialogue">Day 196. I've been seeing more hostile animals migrating this way, so of course my course of action was to create some armor out of their dried skin!</span>"
            Nova cleared his throat.
            "<span class="dialogue">Anyways, yeah, I've got a new backpack and some new armor. I've still got my old garments, as these things get cold quickly, and I swear are perpetually covered in snow! Great for hunting though. Anyways, I'm planning on-</span>"
            Nova was stunned as a massive <i>BOOM</i> was heard outside.
            <br>
            "<span class="dialogue">What just happened?</span>"
            He started to panic as he got up and out of his chair, heading outside the <i>yesotska</i>. There was a billow of smoke. Nova approached, and was horrified.

            Nova sat there on his bed, thinking, terrified.

            He continued sitting in silence, thinking. After a while, he spoke up.

            The light crunches of Nova's footsteps in the snow began, fading out slightly as he made his way toward the ship. Clicks were heard, then the opening of a hatch.
            <br>
            <br>
            "<span class="dialogue">Wait..</span>"
            he paused,
            "<span class="dialogue">I should take you.</span>"
            His footsteps became louder once more, continuing for a while until rustling was heard as Nova tied QZ2 Yawusaku's emergency camera to the wing.
            <br>
            <br>
            He made his way into the cockpit. Through several minutes, the ship began to hum, its turbines began to spin, then to glow. 
            <br>
            Soon enough, Nova took off from Ambe Minor.

"You know, I've never kept a personal log. I have gotten the urge to ever since, well, y'know. I mean, it basically was a log for my eyes only for the first 466 days."
<br>
<br>
"Anyways.. hey."
<br>
<br>
"Things have been great ever since my escape. The Hibuyama's welcomed me back with open arms, and even gave me what they think is "compensation" for what I went through: a brand new life support unit! A bit bulkier, better in extreme conditions.. are they saying they're ready for it all to happen to me again? No idea."
<br>
<br>
"They also gave me a dinky little badge they called the "Adrift" badge for surviving stranded for a while.. yeah. Anyways, I've taken some paid leave since my return, because my Atlas it's technically been nonstop work for over a stellar cycle now. I've attached a few pictures of me exploring one of the moons of the wretched planet which I refuse to name. Do you know how easy things would have been if I crashed here instead?"
<br>
<br>
Nova took a few deep breaths.
<br>
<br>
"Okay, I need to stop thinking of that place. It isn't good for me. I can't leave this system while the EV-3 is stationed here, so.. wait, why are they even still stationed here?" He cleared his throat "Anyways, yeah. Life has been going good, I've been trying to keep my mind off of everything bad, and I've been pretty calm overall. Nova out."
